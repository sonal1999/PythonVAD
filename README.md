Python_vad.py is a modified of prior art that listens to micro-phone and captures
	voice activity in a sound chunck. My modifications just make the app run continouse and use sound buffers instead of reading/writing to file.

This code can be used with later versions that actually send sound chunck to Google for speech to text.
